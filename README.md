# NeuroSimulator
This repository allows for the connection of a cart game on Unity with EEG signals acquired through a headset compatible with the OpenVIBE Acquisition Server. A basic architecture of the working of the system is shown below.

## **Requirements**
The requirements for using this project are:
- Python 3.9
- Tensorflow 2.8
- Unity 2022
- OpenVIBE 3.2.0

## **Specifications for the Incoming Signal**
The EEG signal this system is trained for is of:
- Sampling Frequency of 160Hz
- 16 electrode channels

## **Training of Model**
You can use the pre-trained model for this, or you can train your own with either your data or the one we used which is publically available at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11tCrbFUudiq6_ADMQRNwThn3n-eYqREv?usp=sharing

## **How to use**
Follow the following steps
1. Add "Streaming_and_Classification.py", "Interface_With_Agent.cs" and "Pre-Trained Model" (or your own saved model if you have trained it yourself) in the scripts entry of your agent (prefrably a carting agent).
2. Turn on the OpenVIBE Aquisition Server and adjust the parameters to your choosing and select the used driver after connecting the EEG headset.
3. Run "LSL_Exporting.xml"
4. Run the game
5. Run "Streaming_And_Classification.py"
6. Enjoy!

## **Results**
We ran this on a wheelchair simulator game, available at https://github.com/zeerakt/EEGCart
We had the following results on the Physics Simulation.
